# Welcome {-}

This book offers solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham's book [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/). It is a work in progress and under active development. The code for this book can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/r4ds/mastering_shiny_book_solutions). Your PRs and suggestions are very welcome.
